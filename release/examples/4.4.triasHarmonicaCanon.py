# JS_Bach.Canon.TriasHarmonica.BWV1072.py
#
# This program creates J.S. Bach's 'Trias Harmonica' BWV 1072 canon.
#
# This canon is constructed using two parts (choirs), each consisting
# of four voices. The first part's voices use the original theme,
# each separated by a half-note delay. The second part's voices use
# the inverted theme delayed by a quarter note, each separated by
# a half-note delay.
#
